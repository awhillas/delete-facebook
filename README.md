\* working title

A distributed, decentralised social network architecture based on web standards and existing infrastructure.

Inspired by the [#deletefacebook](https://twitter.com/search?q=delete%20facebook) movement this project has arisen out of the relisation that there is **no current viable option to Facebook** that solves the privacy and data ownership problems of Facebook that [Cambridge Analytica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica) brought to light in March 2018.

Here is an attempt to define a workable system architecture for one or more social networks that are

- [decentralised (distributed)](distributed.md)
- [private (encrypted)](encrypted.md)

The social network software will really be an interface to a list of friends, their PGP public keys and their respective distributed content. Many such interfaces could be setup by ether individuals, public and private organisations while all with equal access to the same data.

The only real original contribution of this project is to:

1. use _existing_ content publish infrasructure as much as possible e.g. blogsphere, Wikis and Web CMS.
2. handle encryption of content without any new technology.

It is also hoped that we might see what a social network might grow into without attention engineering to drive advertising revenue.
